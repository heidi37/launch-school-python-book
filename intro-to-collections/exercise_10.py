# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# the names won't necessarily print in order. "names" is a set and they are not ordered.
