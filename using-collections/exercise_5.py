# Which of the following values can't be used as a key in a dict object, and why?

# 'cat'
# (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2)
# ['a', 'b']
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
# range(5)
# {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}
# 3
# 0.0
# frozenset({1, 4, 9, 16, 25})

# ['a', 'b'] - have to be immutable

# {'a': 1, 'b': 2} - also mutable, has to be built-in immutable object

# {1, 4, 9, 16, 25} - have to be immutable
